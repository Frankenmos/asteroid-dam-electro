A Novel Method for Gravitational Energy Harvesting via Controlled Asteroid Descent

# Asteroid Dam: Gravitational Energy Harvesting via Controlled Asteroid Descent

## Overview

This repository contains research and development material for the **Asteroid Dam** concept, a novel approach to renewable energy harvesting. The concept leverages gravitational potential energy stored in asteroids, redirecting them through controlled descent paths and capturing energy via electromagnetic induction.

## Key Features
- Utilizes Interplanetary Transport Network (ITN) for efficient asteroid redirection.
- Converts gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy, harvested through electromagnetic induction systems.
- Provides secondary benefits via in-situ resource utilization (ISRU).

## Project Structure
- **Research Papers and Drafts:** Core documents outlining theoretical frameworks and feasibility studies.
- **Computational Models:** Planned simulations and orbital mechanics computations.
- **Experimental Designs:** Future work on prototype electromagnetic induction systems.

## Next Steps
- Computational validation through orbital and electromagnetic simulations.
- Engineering feasibility studies.
- Prototype development and testing phases.

## Contributions
The project welcomes collaboration from researchers and engineers interested in innovative renewable energy solutions and space infrastructure.

## License

This project is currently private and intended for academic and collaborative research purposes. Licensing considerations will be addressed at future stages of development.
